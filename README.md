# MCBetterFoods

**MCBetterFoods (MCBF)** is a Minecraft mod that makes the current state of minecraft items more useful than there current boring uses and adds more. Currently Minecraft has a few select items that can be better utilized for more possible recipes instead of their intented use. Minecraft currently hold 20+ items that can be better used for different recipies when cooking. The goal of this mod is to enhance the games culinary diversity that're possible in Minecrafts 3x3 and 2x2 crafting grids with new cooking objects, crops, meals, and more down the road.

## How items are added

**Item Creation (combinations)** play an important role in how this mod interacts with the user and the items to be created. Using combinatronics we get for a 3x3 grid: **1,207,269,217,792 combinations** For the 2x2 grid: **234,256 combinations**. This makes item usage tricky since implementing all possibly crafting recipes would result in too many for the user to remember and take away from Minecrafts standard idea of simple recipes that can be easily used, stacked, and provide consistency. Better Foods aims to take this approach with a Roadmap of implementations.
